# JumpIn-iOS

The idea is very simple : motive people to do more exercises. 
In order to motivate them, we decide to mixt sport but also fun. 
To do this, the user have to make some jumps and then, according to how much jumps the user have done and altitude, the user can have different way of playing our game. 
For example: The more he/she did jumps, the more he/she will have jumps to the game. 
We decide to mix 2 parts : Game and Sport in order to motivate users as much as possible.
